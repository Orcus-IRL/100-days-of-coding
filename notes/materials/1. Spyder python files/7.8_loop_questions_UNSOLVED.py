Question 1
Ask the user for two numbers between 1 and 100. Then count from the
lower number to the higher number. Print the results to the screen.
'''


'''
Question 2
Ask the user to input a string and then print it out to the screen in
reverse order (use a for loop).
'''



'''
Question 3
Ask the user for a number between 1 and 12 and then display a times
table for that number.
'''


'''
Question 4
Can you amend the solution to question 3 so that it just prints out all
times tables between 1 and 12? (no  need to ask user for input)
'''


'''
Question 5
Ask the user to input a sequence of numbers. Then calculate the mean
and print the result
'''


'''
Question 6
Write code that will calculate 15 factorial. (factorial is product of
positive ints up to a given number. e.g 5 factorial is 5x4x3x2x1)
'''


'''
Question 7
Write code to calculate Fibonacci numbers. Create list containing
first 20 Fibonacci numbers, (Fib  numbers made by sum of preceeding
two. Series starts 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ....)
