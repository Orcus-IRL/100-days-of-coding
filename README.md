# 100 Days of Coding

Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding repository! This project documents my coding journey over 100 days, focusing on learning and improving my programming skills, primarily using Python.

## Overview

This repository includes:
- **Daily Progress**: Individual folders for each day's coding activities.
- **Projects**: Various coding projects developed during the challenge.
- **Resources**: Images and documents explaining key concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Orcus-IRL/100-days-of-coding.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd 100-days-of-coding
    ```

3. **Explore the Folders**:
    Each folder is labeled by day (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.), containing the respective day's code and notes.

## Structure

- **Daily Folders**: Contain scripts, notes, and exercises for each day.
- **projects/**: Contains larger coding projects.
- **README.md**: Overview and instructions.
- **SECURITY.md**: Security policy.

## Customization

You can follow along with the challenge or customize the scripts to suit your learning needs. Modify the scripts within each day's folder and experiment with new ideas.
